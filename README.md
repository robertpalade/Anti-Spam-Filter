# Anti-Spam-Filter

This is a Python project which aims to classify emails as spam or clean. 
The model is trained on a dataset which contains two folders, one with clean emails (Clean) and the other one with spam emails (Spam).
The result is displayed in an output file which contains the name of the email followed by the result of the classification: clean or spam.
The trained model is saved in a .sav file.
To run this project you have to give as arguments "-scan", followed by the name of the folder which you want to be scanned and the name of 
the output file, where the result will be saved.
